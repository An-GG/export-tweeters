# export-tweeters

## Install

1. copy the contents of [bookmark_link.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/An-GG/export-tweeters/main/bookmark_link.txt)
2. create a new bookmark (aka add a website to your favorites) in Google Chrome/Safari called 'export-tweeters'
3. paste the copied text into the URL field

## Use

- Go to a user's following/follower list on twitter and then click the bookmark
- Scroll through the entire list, the script will collect all the usernames it sees
- hit the blue copy button once you've got the entire list

> twitter is cringe so you might have trouble with the follower/following page not showing the full list
> - nothing we can do about this at the moment. seems like elon decided on 50 as the current rate limit after consulting his magic 8 ball
